tasks done:

- review cost to attack analysis
- create daily logs/research repo and documents
- added trello cards for solana/cosmos next research steps
- stepping through solana tutorial, taking notes in research doc
- monday meeting
- running solana local node
- call with Charles
- working with cosmos sdk

back to smart contract task. good next step may be to get Solana running locally and follow tutorials to better understand how their execution env works. similarly get Tendermint/Cosmos SDK running locally and follow those tutorials. need to understand how the SDK is set-up. ie. once the boiler plate is created, how does one go about adding in their application layer state machine, state transition functions etc? — do this and produce some research documents.

doing short diversion into Rust. just need to understand what the solana steps are doing in this tutorial.

the Solana hello-world tutorial provides a solana "program" ie. smart contract, written in Rust. we then have the client code, which is just typescript and which uses solana ts libraries to package up a tx and send that tx to our locally running node. so in theory, we should be able to run this entire example repo with little or no modification for our testnet. the element that, i think, we need to port into our tendermint chain is the solana local node which was invoked with `solana-test-validator`. so let's look into that. cloning the solana repo (this is the solana client software). solana local cluster runs fine. source code seems to be all rust. this is all fine, but project is large. maybe ethermint can provide a better starting point?

to get solana style contracts on our testnet we need to define our state ie. accounts etc. then we need our state transition stuff. so we need to be able to take Rust contract code, compile to BPF, deploy that on chain, then define state machine. so, needs to be able to read tx, find contract code, execute contract code using inputs taken from tx — all this done in a VM — determine updated state as result of all that. all of that should be implemented in application layer of cosmos sdk. not clear yet how to pull those necessary elements from solana code into cosmos sdk.

going look into cosmos sdk more, also ethermint. how does ethermint implement EVM etc. via geth, without re-writing geth? CosmWasm _does_ look good to me. Tendermint core with Rust smart contract support. plus we get all the cosmos tooling. just not the solana tooling. so one approach is to use cosmos sdk to build in solana contracts, in which case we either import the solana stuff as libraries, or actually pull in sections of code. the other is to use cosmwasm — but i'm not sure we want to do that.
