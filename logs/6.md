work done:

- asking for docs on solana discord
- working on report
- more research into Diem Move
- meeting

trying to find out more about Move. there are docs describing various aspects of the language, but i can't actually find any implementation anywhere. there are python/java/go SDKs. but these seem to be python/java/go code libraries for interactin with the theoretical diem platform. ie. being able to package up a tx for diem and broadcast. this is very different from the language implementation itself. for that i would hope to find some compiler and other tools which run on the OS.

[move tutorial](https://developers.diem.com/main/docs/move-creating-coins)

this presents another potential path. we could bring Move into Cosmos SDK maybe. we would need to implement in our application layer the Move runtime and whatnot. Move is written in Rust. so maybe we can execute the Move code without building too much extra? but we would need to define accounts of course, and all other rules of the chain.

work done:

- working on slide for smart contracts
- call with BitClout
- call with Galen
- back to working on slide

in order to show how these smart contracts are going to work on this slide i need to do some more research into LLVM and the BPF format. not sure exactly what the runtime there looks like, partly because i think solana hides their IP somewhat by not producing docs.

work done:

- working on research document

## 15

work done:

- reading cosmos sdk docs
- working on visualizations for smart contract slide
- doing cosmwasm install and tutorial

writing the application with cosmos sdk so far looking very granular. seems like steep learning curve. you just define all the functions which dictate the behavior of the state machine. it's completely general, which is good, but the trade-off is that you really are writing everything _almost_ from scratch. it does give you some framework, but a lot must be filled in — and this must (i believe) be done in Golang.

need more details on slide...

## 14

work done:

- review cost to attack analysis
- create daily logs/research repo and documents
- added trello cards for solana/cosmos next research steps
- stepping through solana tutorial, taking notes in research doc
- monday meeting
- running solana local node
- call with Charles
- working with cosmos sdk

back to smart contract task. good next step may be to get Solana running locally and follow tutorials to better understand how their execution env works. similarly get Tendermint/Cosmos SDK running locally and follow those tutorials. need to understand how the SDK is set-up. ie. once the boiler plate is created, how does one go about adding in their application layer state machine, state transition functions etc? — do this and produce some research documents.

doing short diversion into Rust. just need to understand what the solana steps are doing in this tutorial.

the Solana hello-world tutorial provides a solana "program" ie. smart contract, written in Rust. we then have the client code, which is just typescript and which uses solana ts libraries to package up a tx and send that tx to our locally running node. so in theory, we should be able to run this entire example repo with little or no modification for our testnet. the element that, i think, we need to port into our tendermint chain is the solana local node which was invoked with `solana-test-validator`. so let's look into that. cloning the solana repo (this is the solana client software). solana local cluster runs fine. source code seems to be all rust. this is all fine, but project is large. maybe ethermint can provide a better starting point?

to get solana style contracts on our testnet we need to define our state ie. accounts etc. then we need our state transition stuff. so we need to be able to take Rust contract code, compile to BPF, deploy that on chain, then define state machine. so, needs to be able to read tx, find contract code, execute contract code using inputs taken from tx — all this done in a VM — determine updated state as result of all that. all of that should be implemented in application layer of cosmos sdk. not clear yet how to pull those necessary elements from solana code into cosmos sdk.

going look into cosmos sdk more, also ethermint. how does ethermint implement EVM etc. via geth, without re-writing geth? CosmWasm _does_ look good to me. Tendermint core with Rust smart contract support. plus we get all the cosmos tooling. just not the solana tooling. so one approach is to use cosmos sdk to build in solana contracts, in which case we either import the solana stuff as libraries, or actually pull in sections of code. the other is to use cosmwasm — but i'm not sure we want to do that.

these docs will be invaluable to figuring out how the sdk works: <https://docs.cosmos.network/master/intro/sdk-design.html>

creating rough slide for smart contracts on store testnet.
