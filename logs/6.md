reviewing cost to attack analysis. wrote thoughts in email response.

back to smart contract task. good next step may be to get Solana running locally and follow tutorials to better understand how their execution env works. similarly get Tendermint/Cosmos SDK running locally and follow those tutorials. need to understand how the SDK is set-up. ie. once the boiler plate is created, how does one go about adding in their application layer state machine, state transition functions etc? — do this and produce some research documents.
